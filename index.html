        "As part of a collaborative team project, I contributed to the development of the Ricochet Robots board game, a dynamic puzzle-solving game where players must move robots across a grid to reach a target. This project provided invaluable experience in both software engineering and team collaboration. We worked together on GitHub, where each team member was assigned specific tasks aimed at building and refining the various game functionalities. This structure allowed me to gain hands-on experience with both frontend and backend development, contributing to the creation of intuitive user interfaces as well as robust game logic. One unique aspect of our project was the implementation of a version of the game for visually impaired users. This feature aimed to make the game more accessible by providing audio cues and alternative navigation options, allowing visually impaired players to enjoy the game without limitations. It was an important part of the project that highlighted the value of inclusivity in software design and broadened my understanding of designing applications for diverse user needs.",
        "This project implements several versions of cellular automata, including Conway's Game of Life and other patterns such as Random (R), Spaceship (L), and Pulsar (P). It showcases my skills in Java and object-oriented programming, providing a flexible framework for simulating various cellular automaton behaviors. Key features include the simulation of Conway's Game of Life, random initialization of cells, spaceship and pulsar patterns, and user input for customizing grid size, magnification, and pattern type. The project demonstrates my ability to work with algorithms and Java syntax, as well as my understanding of complex systems emerging from simple rules. Example usage: java Cellular 10 100 R runs the cellular automaton for 10 steps on a 100x100 grid with a random pattern.",
        "This project implements the A* algorithm for pathfinding, a project that I thoroughly enjoyed working on. The core challenge was using heuristics to make decision-making smarter within the algorithm, allowing it to find the most efficient paths between two points on a map. I implemented A* to navigate a customizable grid, where different cells can have varying costs, adding a layer of complexity to the pathfinding process. Additionally, I integrated Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms, enabling the comparison of different pathfinding strategies. The customizable map feature made it possible to test the algorithms in more complex scenarios, improving the A* algorithm's performance and testing its ability to find the fastest routes. This project deepened my understanding of graph theory, heuristics, and the importance of optimization in algorithm design.",
        "This project implements a Sudoku board game solver using genetic algorithms and heuristics. The solver applies different algorithms to solve the puzzle, with strategies like column match, row match, and sum of boxes. These algorithms allow the system to evaluate potential solutions and make decisions based on matching numbers and grid constraints. A key feature of the project was the integration of a fitness graph, which tracks the efficiency of the algorithm in real-time, helping to visualize the progress of the genetic algorithm. This visualization shows how the population of candidate solutions evolves over time, ultimately converging toward a solution. The project highlights my skills in algorithmic problem-solving, genetic algorithms, and heuristics, and demonstrates my ability to implement complex systems with optimization techniques. By using multiple heuristics and providing a clear fitness indicator, I was able to optimize the solver and create a more efficient solution process.",
        "This project focuses on creating an AI bot for the TRON game, designed to outperform the built-in bot by strategically covering more cells while avoiding self-trapping or collisions. The algorithm was developed to compete from different starting points on the grid and adapt to dynamic gameplay scenarios. A significant aspect of the project involved implementing various path exploration strategies to optimize movement in competitive scenarios, including games with multiple bots. By simulating different possibilities, the AI bot could effectively balance offensive and defensive moves, aiming to maximize covered cells without compromising its survival. This project showcases my ability to implement intelligent decision-making algorithms, explore competitive strategies, and develop efficient solutions for complex, dynamic environments.",
        "This project involved developing a highly competitive AI bot for StarCraft: BroodWar using the BroodWar API. The bot was specifically designed to maximize the strategic abilities of Zerglings and execute smart plans for a Zerg Rush to secure game victories. A key feature of the bot was its ability to scout enemy bases quickly, utilizing efficient scouting algorithms to locate the enemy as early as possible. It positioned troops strategically in the middle of the map to minimize travel time to the enemy base and prioritized attacking enemy units that could retaliate before focusing on structures. Additionally, the bot performed a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to scout for any remaining enemy units, ensuring complete dominance. The bot demonstrated a high winning rate against all other races, thanks to its adaptive strategies and real-time decision-making. This project highlights my skills in algorithm design, strategic gameplay planning, and real-time API usage to achieve competitive outcomes."
